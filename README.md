# multimethod.php

Multimethods are a functional programming control structure that allow you
to dynamically build-up and manipulate the dispatching behavior of a 
polymorphic function. Inspired by [multimethod.js](https://github.com/KrisJordan/multimethod-js) (description taken from him).
Initially built just for fun =)
